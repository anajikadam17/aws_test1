“We don’t like that. Conceptually, I can tell you I don’t like that,” Trump said, on reports that TikTok’s owner ByteDance was selling part of its US operations to Oracle to avoid a complete shutdown in the country.

The Chinese-owned TikTok has been under the scanner of Washington over concerns about “national security”. However, to assuage the fears, the short-video company decided to shift its headquarters in the US and make tech firm Oracle a minority shareholder.

ByteDance decided to remain the majority shareholder and will not give the source code to any US buyers.


Meanwhile, Trump said that the US deal cannot be approved until all the conditions demanded by Washington are met. At the same time, China also needs to approve ByteDance’s proposed deal with Oracle Corp in order to move ahead with the plan.

“It has to be 100 per cent as far as national security is concerned. And no, I’m not prepared to sign off on anything. I need to see the deal,” Trump told reporters. He also said he would be meeting with officials about it on Thursday.
