Google has pulled down Paytm from its Google PlayStore claiming that the company is violating privacy. Suzanne Frey, Vice President, Product, Android Security and Privacy said: “We don’t allow online casinos or support any unregulated gambling apps that facilitate sports betting. This includes if an app leads consumers to an external website that allows them to participate in paid tournaments to win real money or cash prizes, it is a violation of our policies.” Also Read - 'And We Are Back': Paytm Restored on Play Store Hours After Being Removed By Google

Google further added, “We have these policies to protect users from potential harm. When an app violates these policies, we notify the developer of the violation and remove the app from Google Play until the developer brings the app into compliance. And in the case where there are repeated policy violations, we may take more serious action which may include terminating Google Play Developer accounts. Our policies are applied and enforced on all developers consistently.” Also Read - 'Will Akshay Now Launch Pay-PM'? Twitter Erupts With Funny Memes After Google Removes Paytm From Play Store
