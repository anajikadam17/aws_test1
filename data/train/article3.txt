As per a Reuters report, the move will come into effect from Sunday (September 20), under the two executive orders President Donald Trump had issued over a month ago.


The order said ”as of September 20, any provision of service to distribute or maintain the WeChat or TikTok mobile applications, constituent code, or application updates through an online mobile application store in the U.S. will be prohibited”.

”At the President’s direction, we have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations”, CNN quoted Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as saying.

Notably, the development comes at a time when TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, has been talking with US companies like Microsoft and Oracle to create a new company, TikTok Global, that aims to address US concerns about the security of its users’ data.
